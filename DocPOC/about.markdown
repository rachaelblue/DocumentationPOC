This site is created with Jekyll.  In order to edit and preview any docs hosted here, clone the Github repo and install Jekyll in your terminal:

`sudo gem install jekyll bundler`


Once you've made changes you want to preview, host the site with:

`bundle exec jekyll serve`

Running that command should output the address where you're hosting the site locally, so open your browser and type in the address like:

`localhost:4000` (or whatever the address is).  Refresh and voila.

To render any drafts in the draft folder, add the --draft flag:

`jekyll serve --draft`
